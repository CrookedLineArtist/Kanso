            <h2>Air-condition duct test application</h2>
            <h3>The duct test</h3>
            <p><small>A duct test measures the airtightness and leakages in the system which includes both the inside and outside of a cooled or heated space. By comparing the pressures and flow rates, the test is able to determine the total amount of leakage and the location of any leaks in the system. Such leakages could affect the cooling or heating potential of the system. This is mostly used for spaces which uses air-conditioning or a furnace.</small></p>
