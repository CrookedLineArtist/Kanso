            <h1>Property management and rental <i>platform</i></h1>




            <p>Homzhub is a platform mainly for NRIs or other investors who own properties in India but do not live in
                the same town or country. It allows them to remotely list the property either for management or rental.
            </p>

    <div class="container homzhub ">

        <div>
            <h3>Brief</h2>
                <p>The client had already developed a initial prototype
                    based on their vision but they felt it lacked face value
                    and intuitiveness. The brief required us to restructure the existing interface to make it more
                    usable and intuitive along and develop a modern visual language. </p>
        </div>

    </div>



    <div class="container homzhub ">

        <div>
            <h3>User flows </h2>
                <p>Upon closer inspection we observed that their prototype had major experience drawbacks. Flows were broken frustrating the user. New user task flows were created based on the goals. This helped us understand the functioning of the product better as we pushed to make each process as smooth as possible. </p>

        <div>
            <h3>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>With the acquired knowledge of the user journies the information architecture and interactions for
                each step had to be created. As the platform was information heavy, we aimed at restructuring the
                data and provide it to the user in smaller chunks which were
                relevant to him. While this imrpoved scanability to ensured that the user would not drop out. </p>

            <h3>Top vs Side Navigation</h2>
            <p>With a client adamant on having a side navigation system we strived for a better understanding. Our platform was more focused
                with limited topics of interest. A traditional top navigation is easier to scan and use. Thus being better suited.</p>

                <p>Mainly used by people with off shore properties, it required a communication between owner and tenant. An inbuilt widget system enabled that. The tenant and owner could connect and schedule visits or negotiate rent without having to ever call each other.</p>
