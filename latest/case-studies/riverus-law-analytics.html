            <h1>Riverus law <i>analytics</i></h1>
            <p>Riverus is a legal data analytics platform which uses machine learning to identify and display legal data in an easy-to-use manner. Currently, their first product is for Income Tax Laws.

            <h3>Brief</h2>
                <p>The client came to us with an initial need for a visual upgrade. Scope later unfolded into redesigning the entire product with the addition of newer features. With the goal of being portrayed as more professional and up to date, this was a necessary step for their growth. This would also help attract more clientele.</p>

            <h3>Our journey with income tax laws</h2>
                <p>This project has got to be the most unique weâ€™ve worked on. Income tax law is a dense subject. Taking people years to study and practice, it was a mammoth task to even scratch the surface of this topic. With a traditional project having a linear process, we had to grow with this product. Each process moving back and forth as the product and our understanding evolved over time.</p>

            <h3>A widget game</h2>
                <p>The card system gave birth to widgets. The chunks of grouped information were made noticible, accessible and interesting. Each widget allowed interaction to observe different touch points. This not only increased asthetic appeal but also broke the monotony of textual content of the product. </p>
